# RepoRover: The AI Codebase Navigator üöÄ

RepoRover is a powerful and intuitive Streamlit web application that allows you to have intelligent conversations with any public GitHub repository. Simply provide a repository URL, and RepoRover will clone it, index the code, and empower you to ask questions about the entire codebase or specific files.

*It's highly recommended to replace the line above with a screenshot or a GIF of your application in action\!*

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Analyze Any Public Repo**: Just paste a GitHub URL to start analyzing.
  * **Interactive Code Viewer**: Browse the repository's file structure and view code with syntax highlighting directly in the app.
  * **Repository-Wide Chat**: Ask high-level questions about the project's architecture, functionality, or how different components interact.
  * **File-Specific Chat**: Select a single file to have a focused conversation about its specific logic, functions, or purpose.
  * **AI-Powered by Ollama**: Leverages local language models like `codellama` through Ollama for powerful, private, and free code analysis.
  * **Efficient Vector Search**: Uses ChromaDB to create a searchable vector index of the codebase for fast and relevant context retrieval.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

  * **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
  * **LLM Service**: [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (running models like `codellama`)
  * **Vector Database**: [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/)
  * **Embedding Model**: [Sentence-Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
  * **Text Splitting**: [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
  * **Git Operations**: [GitPython](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

RepoRover follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to answer your questions.

1.  **Ingestion**: When you provide a GitHub URL, the repository is cloned locally.
2.  **Chunking**: Each code file is read and split into smaller, manageable chunks using LangChain's text splitters.
3.  **Embedding & Indexing**: Each chunk of code is converted into a numerical vector (an embedding) using a Sentence-Transformer model. These embeddings are then stored in a local ChromaDB vector database.
4.  **Retrieval & Generation**:
      * When you ask a question, your query is also converted into an embedding.
      * ChromaDB performs a similarity search to find the most relevant code chunks from its database.
      * These relevant chunks (the "context") are combined with your original question into a prompt.
      * The complete prompt is sent to the Ollama language model, which generates a final, context-aware answer.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run RepoRover on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.9+** and `pip`
  * **Git** installed on your system.
  * **Ollama**: You must have [Ollama installed and running](https://ollama.com/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/RepoRover.git
    cd RepoRover
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

    ```txt
    streamlit
    chromadb
    langchain
    sentence-transformers
    GitPython
    ```

    Then, install the packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Pull the Ollama Model**
    RepoRover uses `codellama:7b` by default. Pull it using the following command:

    ```bash
    ollama pull codellama:7b
    ```

    *(Ensure the Ollama application or server is running before you do this.)*

### Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, run the Streamlit app with this command:

```bash
streamlit run your_script_name.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## üí° Future Improvements

  * [ ] Support for private repositories with authentication.
  * [ ] Option to choose different Ollama models from the UI.
  * [ ] Caching indexed repositories to avoid re-processing.
  * [ ] Dockerize the application for easier deployment.
  * [ ] Persist chat history across sessions.
